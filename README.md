# Smart_summarizer

The smart summarizer is an advanced extractive text summarization tool designed to efficiently condense large textual content into concise and meaningful summaries. Built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and graph-based ranking algorithms, it employs cosine similarity and PageRank to identify and prioritize key sentences, ensuring that the most relevant information is retained. Additionally, it integrates Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality using gTTS, enabling audio playback of the generated summary for enhanced accessibility. Developed in Python with dependencies such as NLTK, NetworkX, NumPy, and Playsound, this tool is ideal for researchers, students, and professionals looking to quickly extract essential insights from vast amounts of text. Whether for academic purposes, news summarization, or content curation, Smart Summarizer delivers a seamless, automated, and intelligent solution for efficient information processing. It is also highly beneficial for children with autism, as it provides an auditory aid that enhances comprehension and learning.
